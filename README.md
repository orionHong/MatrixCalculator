# MatrixCalculator
A matrix calculator that can operate addtition, transposition, and multiplication.
**_Sorry about the sizing issue, it was developed in my Surface Pro which has really! high resolution. It has to be this big to make my eyes comfortable. :(**

## Tool Used
- Framework: MVC, Java Swing (all first time implementation)
- IDE: NetBeans

## Some notes
- This is my first programming project, and my first experience with GUI and MVC. 
- source code is under **./src/mvcMatrixCalculator**.
-  **_MatrixCalculator_** contains the core function, althuogh could be improved if I had created a new class for Table or Matrix. (Project: Post-fix evaluation is a better practice for MVC and object-oriented programming)
- **_RunMatrixCalculator.java_** contains _main()_ function.
